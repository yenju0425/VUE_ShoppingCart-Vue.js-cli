# Vue Shopping Cart App (Part II: Vue.js cli)

Welcome to the Vue Shopping Cart App - Part II. This project is a continuation of [Part I](https://github.com/yenju0425/VUE_ShoppingCart-Vue.js-integration#vue-shopping-cart-app-part-i-vuejs-as-a-plugin) and is also from the YouTube tutorial. I have added my own comments and completed all the tasks left off by the original author.

By working through this project, you will be able to:

- Create a Vue project with Vue CLI.
- Learn the difference between `Vue.js` and `Vue CLI`.
- Learn the concept of Single page application.
